# 2022 HACKATHON PROJECT

So True!! is a simple proof-verifier for proofs that use only first order logic written by [Mitchell Holt](https://github.com/mitchellholt) and [Joel Richardson](https://github.com/JoelWantsCoffee).

## Use

Download the source files from src and build them with `ghc Main.hs`. The binaries created can be run given a file name as an argument, e.g. `./Main theorem.jk`. See `theorem.jk` for an example proof.

## TODO

Need to implement
- `Case` proof data type
- using definitions and theorems in proofs and statements of theorems
- using theorems as rules
- reasoning with first order logical connectives
